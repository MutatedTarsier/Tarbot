--**The following repository only includes code files for personal discord music bot project.**--

<br><br><br>As the files cannot be ran without required tokens, below will include images of the bot in action:

1) Start by adding music to queue simply by typing "Tar play [music name]". The bot will automatically join the channel you are in and start playing music.

2) Once the music player reaches the queue title, it will replace the search query with the full music title and thumbnail.

4) The music player will continue to play music until the queue is empty, allowing the player to enjoy music in the background for as long as they would like.
